# 🐶🐱 Cat & Dog Image Classifier - Real-Time Deep Learning Model

This project is a **real-time image classification system** built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **OpenCV**. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to detect and classify **cats** and **dogs** from a webcam feed with live confidence scores and visual feedback.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how deep learning can be used for **image classification tasks**, specifically distinguishing between cats and dogs. The model uses a webcam to capture frames, preprocesses them, and predicts the object category using a trained `.h5` model.

If the confidence of the prediction is below a certain threshold (default: 60%), the result will be labeled as **"Unknown"** to avoid misclassifications.
